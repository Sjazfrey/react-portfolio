                 <p>I am a life long learning and leader that enjoys the beautiful mountains of Colorado. I started my career life as
                  a Physical Therapist Assistant and then got promoted to a Rehab Manager. With the world changing and my therapist
                  friends wanting technology to make their testing and documentation easier and quicker, I soon realized, I could do
                  that! I returned to school to learn coding to help people in a different way. I finished General Assembly's
                  Software Immersion bootcamp in August of 2020.</p>
